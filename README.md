## OASIS TC Open Repository: openc2-lycan-elixir

This GitHub public repository [openc2-lycan-elixir](https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-lycan-elixir/) was created at the request of the [OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2)](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/)as an [OASIS TC Open Repository](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/) to support development of open source resources related to Technical Committee work.

While this TC Open Repository remains associated with the sponsor TC, its development priorities, leadership, intellectual property terms, participation rules, and other matters of governance are [separate and distinct](https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-lycan-elixir/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) from the OASIS TC Process and related policies.

All contributions made to this TC Open Repository are subject to open source license terms expressed in the [MIT License](https://www.oasis-open.org/sites/www.oasis-open.org/files/MIT-License.txt). That license was selected as the declared [applicable license](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses) when the TC Open Repository was created.

As documented in [Public Participation Invited](https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-lycan-elixir/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), contributions to this OASIS TC Open Repository are invited from all parties, whether affiliated with OASIS or not. Participants must have a GitHub account, but no fees or OASIS membership obligations are required. Participation is expected to be consistent with the [OASIS TC Open Repository Guidelines and Procedures](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-repositories), the open source [LICENSE](https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-lycan-elixir/blob/master/LICENSE.md) designated for this particular repository, and the requirement for an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/cla/individual-cla) that governs intellectual property.

## Statement of Purpose

The purpose of this OASIS TC Open repository is to develop a collection of applications and libraries, coded in Elixir, a language that runs on the BEAM virtual machine, for the purpose of implementing OpenC2. Repository assets will demonstrate implementations of OpenC2 that run on BEAM to facilitate other other development efforts. [BEAM stands for Bogdan/Bj√∂rn's Erlang Abstract Machine.]

This openc2-lycan-elixir repository is managed as an open source effort in accordance with the MIT open source license, initially under the leadership and Maintainer role of Duncan Sparrell (sFractal Consulting).

The OASIS OpenC2 Technical Committee was chartered to address matters as they pertain to command and control of cyber defense technologies, and to maintain a library of prototype implementations, sample commands, polyglot implementation and other artifacts as they pertain to the command and control of cyber defense technologies. TC consensus was found to develop and maintain this library as a TC Open Repository. The OpenC2 TC has already initiated creation of transformation (aka lycan) libraries for python, java, and other BEAM languages.

*Additions to Statement of Purpose*

*The TC may include additional content as descriptive text, reflecting project status, milestones, releases, modifications to statement of purpose, etc.
